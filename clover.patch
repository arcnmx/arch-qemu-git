    pc/acpi: Fix booting of macOS with Clover EFI bootloader
    
    This was tested with macOS 10.12.5 and Clover r4114.
    
    Without this patch, the macOS boot process gets stuck at the Apple logo
    without showing any progress bar.
    
    I have documented the process of running macOS on QEMU/KVM at,
    
    https://github.com/kholia/OSX-KVM/
    
    Instead of using this patch, adding an additional command-line knob
    which exposes this setting (force_rev1_fadt) to the user might be a more
    general solution.
